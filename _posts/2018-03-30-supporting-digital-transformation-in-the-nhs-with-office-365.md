# Supporting Digital Transformation in the NHS with Office 365

Many NHS organisations have the challenge of trying to balance the rising expectations of patients for improved care, the rising expectations of staff to be able to work flexibly, and the need to carefully manage costs and keep patient data secure.

Cloud technology like Office 365 can enable you to reduce IT spend  and create operational and clinical benefits. It can provide a major shift in the experience clinical and operation staff have of IT, and give them the tools to redesign how they work to maximise the benefits for patients, themselves and the organisation. It provides a platform for secure, safe collaboration, both internally and externally, enabling integrated care.

The move to cloud based services means not only will organisations benefit from the latest technology and security now but will continue to do so in the future as the service is evergreen and continuously improved and enhanced.

Microsoft is committed to helping NHS organisations move to more digitally enabled healthcare, recognising there are specific functionality requirements of the varied user profiles of people working in the NHS.
